# Malware

Malware, short for "malicious software," is any software designed to harm or exploit a computer system. Some common types of malware include:

- **Viruses**: A type of malware that can replicate itself and spread to other devices.
- **Worms**: A type of malware that can spread itself to other devices without the need to attach itself to a specific program.
- **Trojans**: A type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software in order to gain access to a device.

As an ethical hacker, it is important to be familiar with these different types of malware and understand how they can be used to attack systems. You should also have the ability to use tools such as `clamav` and `sophos` to detect and remove malware, and understand how to prevent malware attacks through the use of antivirus software and other security measures.
